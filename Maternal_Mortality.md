# Pregnant women are dying across the country and we know why – and how to stop that. States are just seating in their own science.    

## The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide funding to 39 states to investigate why women die during and after pregnancy. Mental health, drug overuse and physical injury are the leading causes of death in the U.S.

For decades, pregnant women have been dying in the U.S. at alarming rates. Maternal mortality peaked this year with 32.9 deaths for every 100,000 live births, a sharp increase from 23.8 in 2020, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presented last March. This new rate is comparable to that of Syria or Cuba, according to the latest data available from UNICEF. And American women of color at dying twice as much. 

Committees of state-level experts analyze deaths occurred during pregnancies and postpartum to identify the causes and write recommendations on how to prevent women from dying. The problem is no one is taking action on them.

Maternal Mortality Review Committees — otherwise known as MMRCs — have been implemented in every state across the country since 2018. Currently, 39 states receive federal money and each state’s Department of Health is responsible for carefully selecting a cohort of experts at a state level to review death records and draw conclusions on why pregnant women are dying. 

But the leading cause of death during what is called the perinatal period (pregnancy and up to a year postpartum) are not pregnancy complications – it’s mental health, drug overuse and injuries, including car crashes and gunshots that are killing most women during their pregnancy and postpartum. 

All committees made the same diagnosis: women of color are dying at disproportionate rates, most deaths are postpartum, and a large number of them are preventable. Over the last few years, scientists from across the country continue to write the same recommendations for how to fix the problem: increase access to prenatal care, monitor for postpartum depression, and provide adequate care to patients with substance use disorder.   

But states are ignoring their own science and failing to take action on concrete policy recommendations made by those committees, an investigation found after analyzing each of the 39 MMRC reports. 

For each leading cause of maternal death — mental health, drug abuse and physical injury — we are presenting a national map of the states that explicitly pointed that out in their state reviews of maternal death. 

In addition, to better understand the problem, we gave a closer look at New Mexico, a very diverse and largely rural state that we found served as a very representative example to illustrate how similar challenges take place across of the U.S.

### Physical injury:


In the early 1990s, Dr. Elaine Germano took the reins as New Mexico’s public health director, one of the states with a highest maternal mortality. 

Her background in maternal healthcare mortality but she was invested in it: that’s what she researched in her doctorate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “My job with the health department was not related directly to maternal health, but I did everything to be involved in maternal health practices.”

A group of volunteer health department staffers, who were members of an early version of the MMRC, looked deeper into the state’s maternity care problem. At the time, New Mexico had no system in place to study these shortfalls in maternal healthcare.

Through examining death records, they found out that women were not only failing to go to prenatal checkups, but they were also dying at alarming rates. One data point stuck out the most.

“We uncovered that almost half of the maternal deaths in New Mexico at that time were related to car crashes,” Germano said. “Pregnant women were not wearing seatbelts.”

After that, they introduced a statewide seatbelt campaign. But resources were at an all-time low and there wasn’t a single paid staffer to focus entirely on maternal healthcare. 

“I did feel that there was an urgency, but at the time there were so many other urgent health issues that the health department was dealing with,” Germano said. 

Those problems were, among others, substance abuse, continue to plague the whole country to the day. 


### Drug overuse: 



The maternal mortality public health emergency has a lot to do with the opioid epidemic. 

Overdose is not the only reason why women die because of drugs: opioid withdrawal can cause miscarriage and put the life of the mother at risk.

Withdrawal is not recommended, not even if it is clinically controlled. “It's quite, quite distressing. And they [pregnant women and new moms] are in serious pain and anxiety,” said Michael Herman, an Ob-Gyn Pharmacist at the University of New Mexico.

The treatment in methadone clinics has proved a better outcome, especially during pregnancy but in rural, centralized states, those are usually only in the big cities. In New Mexico, there are only 4 clinics, all of them in Albuquerque. And driving distance can go up to 4 hours.

The projection is not hopeful: Herman and his colleagues are seeing a 340% increase in neonatal opioid withdrawal admissions. The national average is 14 hospital admissions for neonatal opioid withdrawal per 100,000 births and at the University of New Mexico Hospital is seven times higher: 74 hospital admissions per 100,000 births.


### Mental health:



That all leads to the third main cause of death: mental health. From withdrawal anxiety to postpartum depression, pregnancy is one of the most challenging times in a woman’s life and the need for mental health support is pressing. Some end up taking their lives.  

“The problem is that primary health care doesn’t include mental healthcare,” said Dr. Ian Bennet, from the University of Washington, who focuses on maternal child health for vulnerable populations in the U.S.

Primary care centers often refer patients to psychologists and psychiatrists in bigger cities, which means a long drive, time off work, resources to make the commute and overall a bigger commitment to pursue therapy and treatment.

“Mental health is covered on Medicaid but is very little accessible,” he said. 

Remote counseling came as a breakthrough in the era of Zoom but its shortfallings come from a lack of broadband in most rural communities.

All and all, state Departments of Health and the CDC have seating on their desk evidences of why women are dying. It’s just a matter of putting the recommendations committees of expert write in action. 


## Data analysis process

This is the result of a year-long investigative project analyzing the Maternal Mortality Review Committe reports of the 39 states that receive funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The funding comes through the [ERASE program](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/erase-mm/index.html) Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality as of 2023.

I read over 1,700 pages worth of MMRC reports of all 39 states and put together [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hk2BXYL6vYHLNzF6Ct5Q2J1QNdzCsdG2IPszqWx8NpQ/edit?usp=sharing) to compile the main indicators of maternal mortality (pregnancy-related deaths and pregnancy-associated deaths) as well as most repeated recommendations to prevent deaths.  

For each "leading cause of death", "Yes" means that the cause of death is explicited and "no mention" when it didn't appear – but it couldn't be assumed that it was not a leading cause of death, since some of those reports were brief and didn't get into much analytical detail.  

Additionally, I conducted dozens of interviews with recently pregnant women and families, OB-GYN doctors, nurses and midwives, public health experts, and lawmakers, to better understand the problem. 

The resulting maps illustrate the available information that neither the states nor CDC are acting upon to end maternal mortality.
